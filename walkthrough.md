# Builderment Beginner’s Guide

## Waypoint 1: Metal Working
**Goal**: Unlock Metal Working to access Iron Gears and Copper Wire, which are foundational for automation and upgrades.

### Steps to Reach Metal Working:
- **Start with Wood Plank**  
  - **Resources Needed**: 10 Wood Logs  
  - **Tips**: Wood Logs are your starting resource. Set up a simple extractor to gather them from trees. Process them into planks using a basic crafting station.
- **Unlock Wood Frames**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Wood Plank  
  - **Resources Needed**: 10 Wood Planks  
  - **Tips**: Use Wood Planks to craft Wood Frames. This is your first crafted item, so ensure your production is steady.
- **Research Smelting**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Wood Frames  
  - **Resources Needed**: 10 Wood Frames  
  - **Tips**: Smelting lets you process raw ores into usable ingots. Start mining Iron Ore and Copper Core now to prepare.
- **Reach Metal Working**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Smelting  
  - **Resources Needed**: 25 Iron Ingots, 25 Copper Ingots  
  - **Tips**: Smelt Iron Ore into Iron Ingots and Copper Core into Copper Ingots. You’ll need a decent stockpile, so automate mining and smelting if possible.

### Beginner Tips:
- Don’t overcomplicate your layout—keep it simple until you unlock better tools.

## Waypoint 2: Advanced Belts
**Goal**: Unlock Advanced Belts to improve your factory’s logistics with the Belt Splitter, while setting up for future upgrades and gold farming.

### Steps to Reach Advanced Belts:
- **Farm Gold with Copper Wire**  
  - **Unlocked By**: Metal Working (from Waypoint 1)  
  - **Tips**: Use Copper Ingots to craft Copper Wire. Sell excess Copper Wire to earn gold—it’s the best early-game way to build up this currency. Gold is crucial for upgrading buildings, so prioritize this early on.
- **Produce Iron Gears**  
  - **Unlocked By**: Metal Working  
  - **Tips**: Start crafting Iron Gears using Iron Ingots. You’ll need tons of these later for belt speed upgrades, so get production going.
- **Research Advanced Belts**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Working  
  - **Resources Needed**: 30 Iron Gears  
  - **Tips**: Once you’ve got some gold flowing and a few Iron Gears ready, unlock Advanced Belts. The Belt Splitter will make your factory much smoother.

### Why It’s Important:
- The Belt Splitter lets you split resources across multiple lines, reducing clogs and boosting efficiency.
- Gold from Copper Wire sales sets you up for farming gold, which beginners might not realize they’ll need soon.
- Iron Gears are a game-changer—unlocking all 12 belt speed upgrades requires a staggering 498,100 Iron Gears! Starting production early is key to keeping your factory moving fast later on.

### Redesign Your Factory with Belt Splitters:
Once you’ve unlocked Advanced Belts, it’s time for a small factory redesign. Up to this point, you’ve had to keep things inefficient—limiting each conveyor line to about 4 extractors feeding into furnaces or workshops because of their processing limits. Now, with Belt Splitters, you can handle more ore and split the processing to multiple furnaces.

**New Rule of Thumb**: Limit each line to 14 extractors. Add Belt Splitters along the line to divide resources evenly to multiple furnaces or workshops. This setup ensures efficient processing without overloading any single machine.

### Beginner Tips:
- **Keep Wood Frames Cooking**: Let your Wood Frame production run in the background. You’ll need 100 of them soon for Extractor Upgrade 2, which boosts resource gathering. Don’t rush to use them all up now.
- **Focus on Copper Wire Early**: Gold is more valuable than Iron Gears in these first stages. Sell Copper Wire to fund upgrades, then shift focus to gears as your factory grows.
- **Simple Automation**: Set up a basic conveyor line to move Copper Wire and Iron Gears to storage to a Research Lab.
- **Don’t Panic**: You won’t need tons of Iron Gears right away, but starting production now saves time later.

## Waypoint 3: Storage
**Goal**: Unlock Storage to start stockpiling resources instead of selling or using everything right away, setting you up for bigger tech and smoother factory growth.

### Steps to Reach Storage:
- **Unlock Magnets, Workshop Upgrade 2, and Furnace Upgrade 2 (Magnets Likely Already Done)**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Working (from Waypoint 1)  
  - **Resources Needed**:  
    - Magnets: 50 Copper Wire  
    - Workshop Upgrade 2: 200 Copper Wire  
    - Furnace Upgrade 2: 400 Copper Wire  
  - **Tips**: If you’ve been farming Copper Wire for gold like in Waypoint 2, you’ve probably unlocked Magnets already (only 50 Copper Wire). Next, craft 200 more for Workshop Upgrade 2 to boost crafting speed, then 400 for Furnace Upgrade 2 to smelt faster. If you haven’t hit Magnets yet, get 50 Copper Wire now—it’s quick with your setup.
- **Research Metal Frames**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Magnets  
  - **Resources Needed**: 30 Electromagnets  
  - **Tips**: Electromagnets come from Copper Wire and Iron Ingots. Use your smelters to churn out Iron Ingots, then craft enough Electromagnets to unlock Metal Frames.
- **Unlock Storage**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Frames  
  - **Resources Needed**: 150 Metal Frames  
  - **Tips**: Metal Frames are your next big resource. Boost production by feeding Electromagnets into crafting stations, and aim for 150 to get Storage.

### Why It’s Important:
- Storage Buildings let you save resources like Iron Gears and Copper Wire instead of selling them all. Up until now, you’ve had to sell everything to keep going—Storage changes that.
- Sets you up for future tech—like Computers, which needs 25 Metal Frames, or belt upgrades needing 498,100 Iron Gears total.
- Gives you breathing room to plan ahead instead of scrambling for resources.
