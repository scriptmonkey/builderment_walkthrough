# Builderment Beginner’s Guide

## Game Overview
Builderment is a factory-building game where you’re tasked with mining resources on distant planets to save a resource-depleted Earth. Starting with basic tools and raw materials like Wood Logs, you’ll craft items, automate production, and unlock advanced technologies through a tech tree. Your goal is to create an efficient factory using conveyor belts, splitters, and upgraded machines while managing resources and gold (earned by selling items like Copper Wire). This guide walks you through key milestones—or waypoints—to help you build a thriving factory from scratch.

## Goal of This Walkthrough
This guide aims to help you work through the Builderment tech tree to produce **0.5 Earth Tokens (ET) per minute** using **standard recipes only**—no alternative (alt) recipes. Why 0.5 ET per minute? It’s a practical target that balances speed and simplicity, achievable on any map seed you choose. While reaching 1 ET per minute is possible, it often requires long farming periods and more complex setups. By targeting 0.5 ET, you’ll learn the basics, build a solid factory, and finish faster without getting bogged down. (Alt recipes offer different paths, but we’ll save those for advanced topics later!)

### Using the Builderment Calculator
To make your factory-building journey easier, we recommend using the **Builderment Calculator** at [https://saprolord.github.io/Builderment/](https://saprolord.github.io/Builderment/). This tool tells you exactly how many buildings—like extractors, furncaces, and workshops/factories you’ll need to hit your production goals. Here’s why it’s awesome and how to use it for our guide:

- **Why It’s Great**: Planning a factory can feel like guesswork—how many furnaces and workshops do you need for Iron Gears? How many belts for Earth Tokens? The calculator takes the tech tree and does the math for you, showing the precise number of each building to produce a target resource at a specific rate. It’s like having a blueprint for success, saving you time and trial-and-error.
- **How to Use It for 0.5 ET per Minute**:  
  1. Go to [https://saprolord.github.io/Builderment/](https://saprolord.github.io/Builderment/).  
  2. Select **"How much do I need to produce..."** from the top option—this mode calculates what you need to make your desired output.  
  3. In the **Desired Material** dropdown, choose **Earth Token**.  
  4. Set the **Desired Rate** to **0.5** (for 0.5 ET per minute).  
  5. Max out all upgrades:  Click on the "Max All" button so that you have he highest level—to assume fully upgraded buildings, matching our endgame goal.  
  6. Click **Calculate**.  
- **Keep It Handy**: I’ll be using this exact set of calculations throughout this walkthrough to guide our factory setup. You’ll see the results reflected in the waypoints as we build toward 0.5 ET per minute—so bookmark this link or keep the calculator open as we go!
