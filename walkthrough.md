# Builderment Beginner’s Guide

## Game Overview
Builderment is a factory-building game where you’re tasked with mining resources on distant planets to save a resource-depleted Earth. Starting with basic tools and raw materials like Wood Logs, you’ll craft items, automate production, and unlock advanced technologies through a tech tree. Your goal is to create an efficient factory using conveyor belts, splitters, and upgraded machines while managing resources and gold (earned by selling items like Copper Wire). This guide walks you through key milestones—or waypoints—to help you build a thriving factory from scratch.

## Goal of This Walkthrough
This guide aims to help you work through the Builderment tech tree to produce **0.5 Earth Tokens (ET) per minute** using **standard recipes only**—no alternative (alt) recipes. Why 0.5 ET per minute? It’s a practical target that balances speed and simplicity, achievable on any map seed you choose. While reaching 1 ET per minute is possible, it often requires long farming periods and more complex setups. By targeting 0.5 ET, you’ll learn the basics, build a solid factory, and finish faster without getting bogged down. (Alt recipes offer different paths, but we’ll save those for advanced topics later!)
