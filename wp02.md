## Waypoint 2: Advanced Belts
**Goal**: Unlock Advanced Belts to improve your factory’s logistics with the Belt Splitter, while setting up for future upgrades and gold farming.

### Steps to Reach Advanced Belts:
- **Farm Gold with Copper Wire**  
  - **Unlocked By**: Metal Working (from Waypoint 1)  
  - **Tips**: Use Copper Ingots to craft Copper Wire. Sell excess Copper Wire to earn gold—it’s the best early-game way to build up this currency. Gold is crucial for upgrading buildings, so prioritize this early on.
- **Produce Iron Gears**  
  - **Unlocked By**: Metal Working  
  - **Tips**: Start crafting Iron Gears using Iron Ingots. You’ll need tons of these later for belt speed upgrades, so get production going.
- **Research Advanced Belts**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Working  
  - **Resources Needed**: 30 Iron Gears  
  - **Tips**: Once you’ve got some gold flowing and a few Iron Gears ready, unlock Advanced Belts. The Belt Splitter will make your factory much smoother.

### Why It’s Important:
- The Belt Splitter lets you split resources across multiple lines, reducing clogs and boosting efficiency.
- Gold from Copper Wire sales sets you up for farming gold, which beginners might not realize they’ll need soon.
- Iron Gears are a game-changer—unlocking all 12 belt speed upgrades requires a staggering 498,100 Iron Gears! Starting production early is key to keeping your factory moving fast later on.

### Redesign Your Factory with Belt Splitters:
Once you’ve unlocked Advanced Belts, it’s time for a small factory redesign. Up to this point, you’ve had to keep things inefficient—limiting each conveyor line to about 4 extractors feeding into furnaces or workshops because of their processing limits. Now, with Belt Splitters, you can handle more ore and split the processing to multiple furnaces.

**New Rule of Thumb**: Limit each line to 14 extractors. Add Belt Splitters along the line to divide resources evenly to multiple furnaces or workshops. This setup ensures efficient processing without overloading any single machine.

### Beginner Tips:
- **Keep Wood Frames Cooking**: Let your Wood Frame production run in the background. You’ll need 100 of them soon for Extractor Upgrade 2, which boosts resource gathering. Don’t rush to use them all up now.
- **Focus on Copper Wire Early**: Gold is more valuable than Iron Gears in these first stages. Sell Copper Wire to fund upgrades, then shift focus to gears as your factory grows.
- **Simple Automation**: Set up a basic conveyor line to move Copper Wire and Iron Gears to storage to a Research Lab.
- **Don’t Panic**: You won’t need tons of Iron Gears right away, but starting production now saves time later.
