## Waypoint 3: Storage
**Goal**: Unlock Storage to start stockpiling resources instead of selling or using everything right away, setting you up for bigger tech and smoother factory growth.

### Steps to Reach Storage:
- **Unlock Magnets, Workshop Upgrade 2, and Furnace Upgrade 2 (Magnets Likely Already Done)**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Working (from Waypoint 1)  
  - **Resources Needed**:  
    - Magnets: 50 Copper Wire  
    - Workshop Upgrade 2: 200 Copper Wire  
    - Furnace Upgrade 2: 400 Copper Wire  
  - **Tips**: If you’ve been farming Copper Wire for gold like in Waypoint 2, you’ve probably unlocked Magnets already (only 50 Copper Wire). Next, craft 200 more for Workshop Upgrade 2 to boost crafting speed, then 400 for Furnace Upgrade 2 to smelt faster. If you haven’t hit Magnets yet, get 50 Copper Wire now—it’s quick with your setup.
- **Research Metal Frames**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Magnets  
  - **Resources Needed**: 30 Electromagnets  
  - **Tips**: Electromagnets come from Copper Wire and Iron Ingots. Use your smelters to churn out Iron Ingots, then craft enough Electromagnets to unlock Metal Frames.
- **Unlock Storage**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Frames  
  - **Resources Needed**: 150 Metal Frames  
  - **Tips**: Metal Frames are your next big resource. Boost production by feeding Electromagnets into crafting stations, and aim for 150 to get Storage.

### Why It’s Important:
- Storage Buildings let you save resources like Iron Gears and Copper Wire instead of selling them all. Up until now, you’ve had to sell everything to keep going—Storage changes that.
- Sets you up for future tech—like Computers, which needs 25 Metal Frames, or belt upgrades needing 498,100 Iron Gears total.
- Gives you breathing room to plan ahead instead of scrambling for resources.
