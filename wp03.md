## Waypoint 3: Storage
**Goal**: Unlock Storage to start stockpiling resources instead of selling or using everything right away, setting you up for bigger tech and smoother factory growth.

### Steps to Reach Storage:
- **Unlock Magnets, Workshop Upgrade 2, and Furnace Upgrade 2 (Magnets Likely Already Done)**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Working (from Waypoint 1)  
  - **Resources Needed**:  
    - Magnets: 50 Copper Wire  
    - Workshop Upgrade 2: 200 Copper Wire  
    - Furnace Upgrade 2: 400 Copper Wire  
  - **Tips**: If you’ve been farming Copper Wire for gold like in Waypoint 2, you’ve probably unlocked Magnets already (only 50 Copper Wire). Next, craft 200 more for Workshop Upgrade 2 to boost crafting speed, then 400 for Furnace Upgrade 2 to smelt faster. If you haven’t hit Magnets yet, get 50 Copper Wire now—it’s quick with your setup.
- **Research Metal Frames**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Magnets  
  - **Resources Needed**: 30 Electromagnets  
  - **Tips**: Electromagnets come from Copper Wire and Iron Ingots. Use your smelters to churn out Iron Ingots, then craft enough Electromagnets to unlock Metal Frames.
- **Unlock Storage**  
  - **Prerequisite**: Metal Frames  
  - **Resources Needed**: 150 Metal Frames  
  - **Tips**: Metal Frames are your next big resource.

### Why It’s Important:
- Storage Buildings let you save resources like Iron Gears and Copper Wire instead of selling them all. Up until now, you’ve had to sell everything to keep going—Storage changes that.
- Sets you up for future tech—like Computers, which needs 25 Metal Frames, or belt upgrades needing 498,100 Iron Gears total.
- Gives you breathing room to plan ahead instead of scrambling for resources.

### Build Storage Units for Metal Frames:
Now that Storage is unlocked, I recommend building a dedicated set of factories for producing and storing Metal Frames for future use—you’ll need **15,025 Metal Frames** in total from here to Earth Teleporter and beyond. Here’s how to set it up:

- **Build a Metal Frame Farm**: Create a small factory with crafting stations for Wood Frames (from Wood Planks), smelters for Iron Ingots (from Iron Ore) to make Iron Plating, and machine shops to combine Wood Frames and Iron Plating into Metal Frames. Connect the output to belts feeding into storage units.
- **Initial Storage**: Pass Metal Frames into a Research Lab until you unlock Storage 2 (1,000 Metal Frames). This upgrade boosts capacity, letting you store more efficiently.
- **Dedicated Storage Plan**: Once Storage 2 is unlocked, build storage units for these future techs (assuming each unit holds 1,000 Metal Frames):  
  - **Storage 3**: 2,000 Metal Frames (2 storage units)  
  - **Storage 4**: 4,000 Metal Frames (4 storage units)  
  - **Machine Shop 2**: 2,000 Metal Frames (2 storage units)  
  - **Machine Shop 4**: 1,000 Metal Frames (1 storage unit)  
  - **Robotic Arm 4**: 4,000 Metal Frames (4 storage units)  
  - **Industrial Frame**: 1,000 Metal Frames (1 storage unit)  



### Build Storage Farms for Iron Gears
Iron Gears are vital for belt speed upgrades—you’ll need **498,250 Iron Gears** total from here to max out all 12 upgrades. When you finish Speed 10, your Iron Gears will start the research for Speed 11. When Speed 11 has maxed the Iron Gears, we need a storage farm for the last upgrade. We have two options:

#### Option #1: Prep Now, Fill Later:
We’ll set up storage farms now but won’t start filling them until Speed Upgrade 11 Iron Gears are complete:
- **Speed 12**: 150,000 Iron Gears (150 storage units)

#### Option #2: Prep Later, Fill Later:
Set up storage farms when Speed 11 Iron Gears are complete:
- **Speed 12**: 150,000 Iron Gears (150 storage units)  
- **Note**: By the time you get here, you may have better storage unlocked.
